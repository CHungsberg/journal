	    <h1>LAB 11b</h1>
	    <p>In this lab I learned how to use man and grep and sudo, man is the command which explains all of the other commands via documentation. sudo is the command to run a command with root access, and grep is the command to search for a word.</p>
	    <h1>LAB 12</h1>
	    <p>In this lab I modified a powershell script to include a command that documents system info and user info. Powershell can be found by right-clicking the windows icon. Execution policy can be changed by running a command to change the powershell settings.</p>
	    <h1>LAB 13a</h1>
	    <p>In this lab I increased the security by updating the security policy in windows. These changes were accomplished by using the security center, and passwords were required to be more complex and changed more often by the time I was done.</p>
	    <h1>LAB 13b</h1>
		<p>In this lab I modified the group and user permissions of a file. To see file permissions, you have to use the LS command and then you type the file path of the file which you want to see the permissions for. chmod is the command to change file permissions, and using it is as simple as modifying the permissions which are represented by designated letters in a certain format. chown is the command to manually set the owner of a file or folder.</p>
