    <h1>LAB 11b</h1>
    <p>In this lab I learned how to use man and grep and sudo, man is the command which explains all of the other commands via documentation. sudo is the command to run a command with root access, and grep is the command to search for a word.</p>
    <h1>LAB 12</h1>
    <p>In this lab I modified a powershell script to include a command that documents system info and user info. Powershell can be found by right-clicking the windows icon. Execution policy can be changed by running a command to change the powershell settings.</p>
