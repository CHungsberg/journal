	<h1>LAB 1</h1>
	<p>In this lab I learned how to access the machine in skiff from my personal computer through remote desktop. I also set up the necessary programs on my personal computer to accomplish this.</p>
	<h1>Data Types Lab</h1>
	<p>Any file on a computer can be opened and edited with a hex editor, although whether or not the data is human-readable depends on the type of file. There are signed values and unsigned values, which both have a corresponding range of data which they can represent. It is also possible to hide text in the hex code for a file. Hex editors are very useful for editing the raw data of any file if needed.</p>
	<h1>LAB - HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY</h1>
	<p>When building a computer, it is important to make sure that all of the components are compatible with each other. Websites like newegg.com allow for granular precision when applying filters to their comprehensive list of parts, which is incredibly useful for ensuring that only compatible parts are chosen. If everything matches up to the specifications of the motherboard, then building a custom computer is actually fairly simple.</p>
	<h1>System Administration Tools LAB</h1>
	<p>psinfo returns information about the system's hardware</p>
	<p>pslist returns information about the currently running processes</p>
	<p>du returns info about the hard drive and specific folders</p>
	<p>Autoruns64 is a program with a GUI that displays all of the processes that run upon computer startup</p>
	<h1>Creating A Linux VM</h1>
	<p>Luckily, I already had an Ubuntu virtual machine created, so this was very straightforward for me.</p>
	<h1>Event Viewer and Task Scheduler</h1>
	<p>This lab was fairly straightforward. Task scheduler had an older interface, but the fundamentals were fairly similar to how the registry editor operates. Event view was interesting, as I had known that there were logs stored, but I was not aware that there was the ability to create custom filters and lists to view them.</p>

	<h2>Processors</h2>
	<p>The computer processor is the brain of the computer. It can perform millions of calculations every second and does all of the logic comparisons and math manipulation required. It is also the most important factor in determining how powerful a computer is. There are many manufacturers, but Intel and AMD are the most popular. Unlike human minds, computer processors can only operate with binary signals, represented with 1s and 0s.</p>
	<p>Although CPUs can calculate incredibly quickly, they cannot do it all in one thread. They have to break up the task into multiple concurrent threads for maximum efficiency. In terms of improving efficiency, there are 3 options. You can increase the amount of cycles per second, increase the number of channels which can process, or process data more eefficiently.</p>
	<p>Processors need to store information too, which is done in the form of its cache. The cache is the highest speed storage which is available to the processor, at the cost of very limited space for information. The first alternative is the RAM, which is higher capacity but slower, and the second alternative is the storage drive, which is meant for long term storage, with a massive capacity at the cost of very slow read/write.</p>
