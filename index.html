	    <h1>LAB 8</h1>
		<p>In this lab I explored the processes that were currently running on the computer, as well as the system resources which were being used by the processes. The difference between private bites and working sad is that the private bites are catalogued and in the memory, while the working session includes the page file and extra space. To launch the program from the command line, you need to type the file path and press enter, and it opens. DU is a program that allows the user to view information about the storage usage, and which files are taking up a lot of space. -l specifies the level of search, while -c specifies.</p>
	    <h1>LAB 9</h1>
		<p> in this lab, I explored the accessibility options of the windows operating system. To change the text size, you need to navigate to the display section of settings and increase the magnification level. To turn on sticky keys, you need to press the shift key five times in a row, or hold it for eight seconds in a row. Color filter and display contrast options can also be set via the display category. It's possible to change the keyboard loadout by going to the input devices tab than the keyboard sub folder, and changing the layout.</p>
	    <h1>LAB 10a</h1>
		<p> this will help, I learned how to use the network tools to trace the server location of a website. The ping command measures how long it takes to communicate with a given website. nslookup returns some general information about a web address. traceroute is the command to trace the path that a packet of data takes through the internet.</p>
	    <h1>LAB 10b</h1>
	    <p></p>
	    <h1>LAB 11b</h1>
	    <p>In this lab I learned how to use man and grep and sudo, man is the command which explains all of the other commands via documentation. sudo is the command to run a command with root access, and grep is the command to search for a word.</p>
	    <h1>LAB 12</h1>
	    <p>In this lab I modified a powershell script to include a command that documents system info and user info. Powershell can be found by right-clicking the windows icon. Execution policy can be changed by running a command to change the powershell settings.</p>
	    <h1>LAB 13a</h1>
	    <p>In this lab I increased the security by updating the security policy in windows. These changes were accomplished by using the security center, and passwords were required to be more complex and changed more often by the time I was done.</p>
	    <h1>LAB 13b</h1>
		<p>In this lab I modified the group and user permissions of a file. To see file permissions, you have to use the LS command and then you type the file path of the file which you want to see the permissions for. chmod is the command to change file permissions, and using it is as simple as modifying the permissions which are represented by designated letters in a certain format. chown is the command to manually set the owner of a file or folder.</p>
