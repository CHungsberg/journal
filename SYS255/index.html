	<h1>LAB 1</h1>
	<p>Throughout the lab I didnâ€™t encounter any issue until I got to the part where I needed to configure the pfsense web interface. For the longest time I could not get any connection whatsoever to the webpage, it would just keep loading and never connect. Eventually I figured out that the issue was that the workstation VM was configured to use the WAN instead of the LAN, which is why it was never able to connect. I learned how to configure pfsense, and how to connect a windows workstation to a machine which is running pfsense to finalize the configuration process.</p>
